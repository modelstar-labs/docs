# ML functions for SQL

This family of SQL functions can be used to complete end-to-end ML projects. It means the functions automatically:
- generate and deploy ML models;
- create necessary data projects and visualization;
- manage ML artifacts.

It's the easiest way to run forecast and churn analysis in Snowflake using the tools data teams are already familiar with, namely SQL and DBT.

## Function list

- Forecast
  - [univariate_time_series_forecast](univariate-time-series-forecast)
  - [train_binary_classifier](train-binary-classifier)
