# ML functions for SQL

This family of SQL functions can be used to complete end-to-end ML projects. It means the functions automatically:
- generate and deploy ML models;
- create necessary data projects and visualization;
- manage ML artifacts.

It's the easiest way to run forecast and churn analysis in Snowflake using the tools data teams are already familiar with, namely SQL and DBT.

## Function list

- Forecast
  - [univariant_time_series_forecast](univariant-time-series-forecast)
  - multivariant-time-series-forecast(WIP)
- Churn prediction (to be released in v0.21)
