# Introduction

ModelStar enables data teams to get more done with less SQL. With a few lines of SQL, data warehouse/lakehouse users can:
- Train and deploy AI and machine learning models. 
- Receive and send data to SaaS services.
- Create data objects.

## Who are the target users?
- Anyone who knows basic SQL. 
- Snowflake and DBT users.

We will soon add support to other data platforms, such as Databricks, Redshift.
